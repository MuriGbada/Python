# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. The winner is determined according to a set of rules.
If the two players choose the same “character” it’s a tie, and the game repeats
Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats Paper.

The task is to create a simple version of this game with Python. One player will be controlled by the computer and the other player controlled by the user (i.e CPU vs Player). 

The inbuilt Python module random and its choice method are used.
